# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project is to analyze a set of stocks using green energy and use the results to derive to a recommendation on investment. With increased stock data to analyze, this project will also look at different opportunities to improve the performance and flexibility of the analysis approach to scale to these needs.

### Results

### Yearly Stock Performance

Comparing 2017 to 2018 we could clearly see a higher returns in 2017. Except for 1 all other stocks higher returns. Daily volume picked up in 2018 mainly for few stocks ENPH, RUN and DQ. Of them ENPH and RUN had positive returns in 2018 while DQ went negative. A risk free recommendation will be to look at ENPH with increase volume of 174% and growth after looking at its upcoming business plan. RUN looks to be on the growing side too with 88% increase in volume and 84% increase in stock price. It could be one to look to diversify the investment plan. Below are the stock analysis result images.

### Execution Time

By refactoring the code to avoid nested loops there was a significant improvement in performance. This can really help in analysing a larger number of stocks for future cases.

Added one more approach without having to define the list of stocks. Using these approaches built a test process to compare performance. Results are in the below table. Code and Sheeets available in the excel - [VBA_Challenge](VBA_Challenge.xlsx)
